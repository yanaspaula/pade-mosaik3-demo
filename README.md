# PADE + Mosaik 3.0 example integration

This is a modification of [PADE/Mosaik's Demo](https://github.com/grei-ufc/mosaik-demo-wesaac-2019) to implement it with Mosaik 3.0.

First, install the package's dependencies:

```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

Then, install PADE, clonning it from its [github repository](https://github.com/grei-ufc/pade.git) and typing in terminal:

```
python setup.py install
```


To start the demo, just type:

```
python launcher.py
```
